## About Tic-tac-toe:
Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game (or a single-player game against the computer) in which
players choose markers: X and O , and take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player
who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the
game.
